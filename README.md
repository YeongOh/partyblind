My goal was to create a full stack community forum with React.
Followings are the main features of this project.
 - Basic CRUD operations for posts and comments
 - Form validations
 - JWT Authentication with Access and Refresh tokens

My understanding for React, Javascript, Backend has improved as I run this project. However, I decided to not continue to not work on it anymore. As I continue to try to add features into it, I realized my foundation knowledge for Javascript, HTML and React are not good for my liking and I was starting to spend a lot of time on Backend than Frontend. I concluded that spending more time on easier problems would be more efficient for my level. I really enjoyed doing this project though. I will probably make another community forum in the future.

Main stacks used
- React
- Node 
- Express
- MongoDB

Other frameworks and libraries
- React Router
- Tailwind
- Axios
- Json Web Tokens
